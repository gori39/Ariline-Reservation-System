# Ariline-Reservation-System

## Use of Project
This app is made for a flight admin, where the admin is the person who handles all of the
flight companies operations using our app. The various functionalities include:

● Customer Creation
● Customer Search
● Customer Data Updation
● Flight Creation
● Ticket Booking
● User Creation

This app will only be accessible to authorized users, and this will be facilitated
by a login screen that will require a username and password.

## Concepts Used


● Java Swing
  Several swing components were used in the project, like JFrame, JPanel, JOptionPane,
  etc. To read more about these, please refer to the pdf sent after the minor projects. That
  much will be enough.

● Java AWT
  AWT Concepts used include all of the ActionListener functions. These basically get
  called automatically whenever a particular swing element is clicked on, and whatever we
  code inside will decide what happens if the user clicks on a particular button or a menu
  item and so on.

● MySQL
  This was the chosen Database used to keep all the records. Very basic commands were
  used, which you can find in various files throughout the project. We have created 4
  tables in total for Customers, Flights, Tickets, and Users. Just brush up on basic SQL
  commands, especially those that were used in the project.

● JDBC Driver
  A JDBC driver (Java Database Connectivity driver) is a small piece of software that
  allows JDBC to connect to different databases. Essentially, a JDBC driver makes it
  possible to do three things: Establish a connection with a data source. Send queries and
  update statements to the data source. Please understand what each of the four
  statements that I have told you about during the sessions does. Other than that also
  understand the functions of PreparedStatement, Connection variable and
  ExecuteQuery(), etc.
